# Replicable Randomization in Stata

## What does replicable randomization mean and why is it important?
Replicable randomization means that anyone else that have access to your code and your data can run the randomization code again and get the exact same result again even though the results were initially randomized.

This is very important from the perspective of research transparency to show that your randomization was done properly and that your results are not invalid due to improper randomization. More and more journals are requiring that the code that shows how the randomization was done is submitted before accepting any paper that depends on randomization, for example RCTs.

Therefore, whenever we randomize anything in a research project, for example, random sampling or random treatment assignment, it is very important that anyone else, can run the randomization again and get the same results so that it can be verified that the randomization was not rigged or in any other way manipulated. It is not difficult to do so in Stata, but it requires that some specific steps are followed.

## How do make a randomization replicable in Stata?

There are three rules that must be satisfied for a randomization in Stata to be fully replicable. This section list those three rules and explain why they are necessary.

## How to implement in Stata

This section explains how the three rules are implemented in Stata.
