# Part-2. Preparations
> These instructions are supposed to be shared with the test taker well before the test. We recommend the all test takers to read these instructions carefully to ensure that the test is done under fair conditions, that no test taker fail on a silly technical detail, and that previous knowledge in any specific topic should matter as little as possible.

The rest of the instructions needed for this task will be added to this folder at the time of the actual test.

### Topic - Instruction for best practice in Stata

We will not share anymore details for this test other than the title of this section. However, we do strongly recommend that you go through the recommended preparations in relation to the format we expect them to use for the submission to this part.

### Format for submission

We want you to submit you submission in well formatted [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). There is a lot of resources online as this is a very commonly used format for technical documentation online. Markdown is easy to learn and all you need to learn for this tests you can learn in a 5-10 minutes.

In the end we need you to send your text formatted in markdown with the file extension .md. If you do not know how to do that, just copy and paste the markdown text to Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac) and save in .txt format.
