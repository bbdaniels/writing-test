# Part-2. Preparations
> These instructions are supposed to be shared with the test taker well before the test. We recommend the all test takers to read these instructions carefully to ensure that the test is done under fair conditions, that no test taker fail on a silly technical detail, and that previous knowledge in any specific topic should matter as little as possible.

The rest of the instructions needed for this task will be added to this folder at the time of the actual test.

### Topic - Instruction for best practice in Stata

We will not share anymore details for this test other than the title of this section. However, we do strongly recommend that you go through the recommended preparations in relation to the format we expect them to use for the submission to this part.

### Format for submission

We want the test takers to submit their submission in well formatted [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). There is a lot of resources online as this is a very commonly used format for technical documentation online.



Here is a
* [Markdown Tutorial](http://agea.github.io/tutorial.md/) - this will help you get started with the basics, and you are probably overcomplicated
* [Cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
* [Markdown Compiler](https://dillinger.io/) - use this to test your markdown formatting


# Part 2. - Write documentation from a draft
Assumptions for this test:
* The test taker should not be required to research a topic as that will take too long time, and that is usually not the case for a typical intern task.
* Provide a template with an unformatted structure that will help the test taker get started.

The test:
* Write a short article in markdown format on how to do a replicable randomization in Stata
    * Take the randomization presentation from track 1 in the FC training. Have the intern take the information in that presentation and make it into a short text. This topic and this presentation is selected because of the following reasons:
        * Relevant topic
        * The presentation is very informative but the explanations use graphs, so the test taker will need to come up with how to explain the same thing in text.
        * Topic that is both theoretical and code practical. A great submission can include text that is highlighted with code snippets.
* I have prepared a very rough template [here](https://github.com/kbjarkefur/writing-test/blob/master/part2-template.md).
    * Click the button that says `raw`
    * Copy the text from the _raw_ page into any code editor or text editor of your choice
        * Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on Mac or search _markdown compiler_ on the internet (link to one example below)
