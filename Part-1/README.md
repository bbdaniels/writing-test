# Part-1. Preparations
> These instructions are supposed to be shared with the test taker well before the test. We recommend the all test takers to read these instructions carefully to ensure that the test is done under fair conditions, that no test taker fail on a silly technical detail, and that previous knowledge in any specific topic should matter as little as possible.

The rest of the instructions needed for this task will be added to this folder at the time of the actual test.

### Topic - ietoolkit

As preparation for this part of the test we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the Stata package *ietoolkit*. You can install the commands by typing `ssc install ietoolkit` in Stata. You do not need to familiarize yourself with all commands in *ietoolkit*. If some commands stand out as more interesting to you, then you can focus your preparations on them.

Below are a few options for how you can familiar yourself with the package. The most important resource for you to familiarize yourself with for this test is the help files. There is absolutely no need to memorize anything from the resources below, we just want to you to familiarize yourself with what information you can find where, how the help files are structured and how they are written.

#### Links to *ietoolkit* documentation:
- Stata help files - type `help name_of_command` in Stata where you replace `name_of_command` with any of the commands in the package to read the help files for the commands. You must install the package first (see above).
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/worldbank/ietoolkit) - Link to the repo for *ietoolkit* where you find a list of the commands currently in the package.
- [DIME Wiki Articles](https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/Stata_Coding_Practices#ietoolkit) - link to the section of the DIME Wiki where you can find wiki articles for each command in *ietoolkit*.
