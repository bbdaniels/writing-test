# Part-1. Test instructions
In this part we want to test your ability to identify documentation that needs to be improved and your ability to express why it needs to be improved. Incorrect spelling and bad grammar are definitely reasons why documentation could be bad, but make sure to not get stuck on that.

Documentation could be bad for so many more reasons. Here are examples of reasons why documentation needs improvement:
* Spelling and grammar
* broken links, broken formatting, etc.
* Unnecessary usage of advanced or technical terms, or lack or explanation when using such terms can't be avoided
* Unnecessarily complicated way of describing something
* Something that is missing or too briefly explained
* Too much previous knowledge is required to understand something
* Things are explained in the wrong order, or the most useful information comes to far down

For this test we want you to provide feedback on one ore more sections in any of the help files for *ietoolkit* ([installation instructions](./README.md)). For this task we are much more interested in hearing about **why** you think a section of the helpfile above needs improvement, rather than **how** you would improve it. You may still use a suggestion for to _how_ to improve a section of the help files as and explanation to _why_ it needs improvement, but just the _how_ is not what we are interested in.

Remember that bad documentation is any documentation that you find difficult to follow, or that you think any typical user find difficult to follow, and that could be for any of the reasons listed in the bullet point above

The helpfiles you are asked to provide are written by us, but it is really difficult for us to write documentation that is easy to follow for someone that does not know these commands as well as we do. So do not worry about not knowing these resources that well as we do, as a matter of fact, that is your main advantage to doing well at this test.

We do not expect you to write a long paragraph. Show your ability to identify documentation in need of improvement, write clear directions to which section you picked and a justification to why. You can decide yourself between picking several sections and provide only short justifications or picking one section and provide a short discussion on what can be improved in that sections.

Send your submission in any format described [here](./README.md) together with your submission for Part 2.

Good Luck!
