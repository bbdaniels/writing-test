# DIME Writing Test

The test is composed of two parts. You can find instructions on how we recommend you to prepare yourself for this test by clicking the links below:

- [Part 1 Preparations](Part-1\README.md)
- [Part 2 Preparations](Part-2\README.md)

We ***strongly*** recommend that you read through those two pages before the writing test.

To ensure an as fair as possible evaluation between test takers and for the test takers to know what we think is good technical writing, we have prepared the following [evaluations guidelines](evaluations-guidelines.md) that we recoemmend that you read before the test.
