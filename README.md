# DIME Writing Test

## List of the parts of the writing text

The test are composed of the following parts:

### 1. - Reviewing existing documentation
The test taker will be asked to Look at the help files in *ietoolkit*. The exercise will then be to find some part of the documentation that can be improved.
* The purpose of this test is for the test taker to show that can express the difference between good documentation and bad documentation.
    * Test takers should find parts of the *ietoolkit* documentation that they think can be difficult to understand for a typical user, and explain why they think that part will be difficult to understand
    * Test takers can make suggestions for how to improve the documentation as a way to explain why it needs to be improved, but we are more interested in *why* the test takers thinks it can be improved rather than *how* it can be improved.
    * The test is not about picking the part of the documentation in most need of improvement, it is about the test takers ability to discuss the topic of good and bad documentation
* The improvements can relate to anything in the list below. Multiple things to improve can be suggested if the test taker have time to do so.
    * Typos/broken links/broken formatting etc.
    * Unnecessary usage of advanced or technical terms, or lack or explanation when those terms are needed
    * Unnecessarily complicated way of describing something
    * Something that is missing or too briefly explained.
    * Too much previous knowledge is assumed in the explanation.

### 2. - Write documentation from a draft
Assumptions for this test: 
* The test taker will not be required to write something starting from an empty paper, as that will take too long time
* The test should not be about researching the topic, so most if not all of the information needed for this part should be given to the test taker.
