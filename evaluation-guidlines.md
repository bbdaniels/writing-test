# Guidelines for how we will evaluate the writing test
We are testing your ability to write technical text and not your ability to write literature. In addition to that, the majority of our users are non-native English speakers and some have just a limited knowledge of English. Many of our users does also not come from a very technical background, so we cannot use too advanced language. In short, we much rather have our documentation be useful to non-native non-technical users rather than winning the praise of native speakers, literature prize comities or programmers. Although, most programmers would agree with this approach to documentation.

## Therefore, make sure that the text you write follows these guidelines:
* Write in the most simple but still correct and informative way possible
  * Always choose a simpler word over a difficult word
  * Always choose a simpler way to phrase something over an advanced way to phrase something
  * It is not a problem if native speakers find the level of the text too simple or seem like taken from a kid's book as long as it is a effective way to explain something for most people.
* When a technical/advanced word is required, make sure to explain it.
  * No one reads documentation from top to bottom and it is therefore ok to repeat explanations, especially where it is extra important that the word is not misunderstood.
  * Although, breaking up the text with too much explanation makes the text hard to follow. Finding this balance is perhaps the most difficult thing when writing really good technical text.
* Use examples that someone reading the text can copy and follow themselves.

## General good technical writing principles
* Segment your text so that it can easily be updated. The tools we develop will be updated in the future, and then the documentation you write will be updated by other people than you.
  * To the extent possible, do not write paragraphs that depends on something written in a previous paragraph or how it is written there. Aim for making it as easily as possible (require as few edits in your paragraph as possible) for anyone in the future to:
    * Add a paragraph before your paragraph
    * Edit a paragraph before or after your paragraph
    * Move your paragraph
    * Move a paragraph before or after your paragraph
* Make your documentation *skimmable*. That means that it should be possible to find something without reading the full text. Ways to achieve this are
  * Use clear titles of your sections
  * Use bullet points where possible
  * Highlight key terms
